                <p class="about-me-content">Born in the corn jungles of Illinois, Matt was surrounded by vegetables and subpar sports teams from
                    day
                    1. The
                    lack of success that surrounded him was <em>frustrating</em>. Matt was a "winner", and knew he had
                    to
                    get out.
                </p>

                <p class="about-me-content">The next logical step for Matt was to move to a different city - one with a winning attitude. Matt
                    pulled a
                    "Lebron" by leaving a city devoid of opportunity and relocated to Boston. 3 World Series, 5 Super
                    Bowls, 1 NBA
                    Championship, and 1
                    Stanley Cup later, Matt is still in New England, basking in the "winning glory". </p>

                <p class="about-me-content">Matt has mimiced the winning ways of New England, and applied them to his career. "Do Your Job" and
                    "No
                    Days
                    Off" are tattooed on his forehead, impressing potential employers. </p>

                <p class="about-me-content">Now the Digital Marketing Strategist at an Ad Agency, Matt makes a living behind a computer.
                    (Thankfully...
                    Clients don't take kindly to permanent facial ink on someone who's taking their money) He currently
                    develops
                    and manages annoying online advertisements, and couldn't be happier.</p>
                <p class="about-me-content">On his free time, when he has some, Matt is the top dog on his Slow Pitch Softball team. He excels at hitting dingers and arguing balls and strikes. </p>
